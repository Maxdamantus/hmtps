This is an reasonably simple tool for syncing a directory of music to some MTP device.
It tries to optimise bandwidth-wise by identifying sources using SHA512 sums.

./hmtpsdb <directory> [<database>]
This will generate or update the database file, *database* (if unspecified will use *directory*/.hmtpsdb).
It will sum each file in the tree, unless it already exists in the database file, with the same modification
time. The first time, it needs to sum everything so could take a while. No differences will just have it
check mtimes, which is fast.

./hmtpsup <directory> [<database>]
This will read the *database* file (same default rules as before) and connect to the first MTP device, first
removing all tracks not listed in the database (by the SHA512 sums), then add all the songs listed in the
database but not on the device.

A useful setup might be to set up a few "profile" directories, each with symbolic links to perhaps some trees
in a global music directory, so that the set of songs on the device can easily be changed (./hmtpsup doesn't
care about filenames - only SHA512 sums so won't waste time deleting and reuploading files already on there
from the previous profile)
